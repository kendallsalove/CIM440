# Frog Frenzy

The goal of the game is to protect the frog by eating all of the flies. Use your mouse to catch the flies. The reach of your mouse has been restricted. You will only be able to catch the flies when they are in your reach. The number of flies caught will be counted at the top. If the frog is hit by a fly, the game is over.
